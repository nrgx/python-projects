#Python Projects

This repository is my Python projects portfolio.
- **What does and will this repo contain?**\
Any kind of tutorials on the Internet that I find interesting
  (currently I'm trying to implement all the projects from 
  [DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-project-ideas/)).
- **Where is the source ideas for projects?**\
All the projects are from Internet surfing. There is a small list of sources.
  - [DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/python-project-ideas/)
  - [From this Gist](https://gist.github.com/MWins/41c6fec2122dd47fdfaca31924647499)
  - [Upgrad](https://www.upgrad.com/blog/python-projects-ideas-topics-beginners/)
  - [RealPython](https://realpython.com/intermediate-python-project-ideas/)

  - [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-projects-for-beginners/)
  - [Intellipat](https://intellipaat.com/blog/python-project-ideas-for-beginners/)
  - Own ideas\
    (Links in the list contain repeating projects, so they can be skipped)
- **In what areas are these projects?**\
Whatever area, be it AI/ML models, gamedev related, web-based, cli tools, mobile apps etc.
- **Structure of projects**
Structure of projects is made by grading by their complexity (easy, middle, hard) + area of usage 
  (python script - py, web, ml, mobile), like tic-tac-toe and dice simulator are in easypy, 
  e-commerce shop with recommendation system in middleweb and computer vision or image recognition projects in hardml,
  etc. Overtime the idea of structuring will be clear.
